    /*
        WEIRD BUG ALERT!

        It was discovered that some alerts did not display their body text.
        In the process of trying to work out what was happening, I created
        a string containing the number of lines drawn by MADrawTextWrap and
        drew this on the screen so I could see what was actually happening.
        When I did this, the body text started appearing as well as the text
        showing how many lines it had drawn. I then found that it was the
        process of creating a string and putting something in it which was
        allowing the text to be drawn. I actually have no idea why this fixes
        the bug with drawing the body text. It feels like a memory management
        thing, but I can't figure it out.
